Building
--------
You need to populate `app/src/main/java/com/bourke/glimmr/common/Keys.java` with a
[Flickr API Key](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html).

Then import to Android Studio and build.

You can also build from the command line using:

```bash
gradle build
```

Contributing
------------
Pull requests are of course welcome, all I ask is that you follow the existing
style of the code and as set out by
http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html
